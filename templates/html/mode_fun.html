<p>Winter is coming and it's not the easiest time to live.</p>
<p>In this mode there is no end goal and you are free to explore the game. Look out for the body temperature which you can regain by firing up a furnace. The land is plagued with the orcs who are also looking for resources to survive this harsh time.</p>
